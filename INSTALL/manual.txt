This file has toolchains build/installation instructions. See tech_req.txt for
 technical requirements.

1. Use computer running Gentoo Linux or its dialect, or install portage package
 manager onto rpm-ish or Debian-ish or whatever Linux.

2. Find or create overlay. Overlay is a place for your private .ebuild scripts,
 and also a place where crossdev script stores .ebuild's.

 Read Gentoo handbook on how to create overlay.

3. Put my .ebuild's and .eclass'es into the overlay:

 /your/private/overlay/sage-on-gentoo
                      /bionic-core
                      ...
                      alien-libc/musl
                                /uclibc
                                ....
                      /eclass/crosstool-meets-uclibc.eclass
                              fat-gentoo.eclass


4. Add alien-libc to categories list:

 echo alien-libc >> /etc/portage/categories

5. Check /etc/portage/make.conf (especially CFLAGS and MAKEOPTS)

 ABI_X86 should be unset or set to its default value:

 ABI_X86="32 64"

6. Make sure portage tmp directory (denoted PORTAGE_TMPDIR in make.conf) can
 take extra gigabyte.

6. Replace /your/private/overlay in uninstall.install script with real path to
 your overlay. Run the script as root. It should auto-magically download some
 .zip's from github.com and possibly some files from a standard Gentoo mirror,
 before building. Build time depends on your computer capabilities. It takes
 about 10 minutes on 32-proc Intel.

 If emerge command called by uninstall.install says 'there are no ebuilds to
 satisfy "alien-libc/uclibc-pass0"' then you should register overlay in
 make.conf:

 PORTDIR_OVERLAY="$PORTDIR_OVERLAY /your/private/overlay"
